_**Rice - CMOR 438 Data Science and Machine Learning Final Project**_

This repository is created by Xinyi Li, a current sophomore at Rice, to showcase all the projects for CMOR 438 (Instructor: Dr. Randy R. Davila) during Spring 2025. 

This repository implements machine learning algorithms to analyze relationships between leisure/vocational interests and psychological/organizational outcomes using survey data. Contains both supervised and unsupervised approaches for exploratory analysis and prediction.

**Content**

_Supervised Learning_
• The Perceptron
• Linear Regression
• Logistic Regression
• Neural Networks
• K Nearest Neighbors
• Decision Trees / Regression Trees
• Random Forests
• Other Ensemble Methods, including Boosting

_Unsupervised Learning_
• K-Means Clustering
• DBSCAN
• Principal Component Analysis
• Image Compression with the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

**Dataset**

All data are pulled from a survey on leisure and vocational interest, which contains responses from 121 participants. Features include, 18 psychometric scales (industrial and organizational psychology), 8 objective behavioral criteria (e.g., organizational status, social media usage, and charity behaviors), and 9 demographic variables (e.g., age, education level and household income). There are 908 in total, including composited columns and multi-question scales.
