_**Unsupervised Learning**_

📚 What is Unsupervised Learning?

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained without labeled data. This means the algorithm is given input data without knowing the “correct” answers or outcomes — it’s up to the model to discover patterns, groupings, or structure hidden inside the data.

⚙️ How Unsupervised Learning Works

- The algorithm is fed a dataset with only input features, no labels.
- It analyzes relationships between data points, i.e., Which points are similar or close together? Which directions have the most variance? How can we group or compress the data meaningfully?
- It outputs structure: clusters, compressed representations, or low-dimensional projections.

🔀 Two Main Types of Unsupervised Learning

- Clustering: grouping similar data points (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN)
- Dimensionality reduction: simplifying data while preserving its essential structure (e.g., PCA, SVD)

🔧 Unsupervised Learning Algorithms

- K-Means Clustering
- DBSCAN
- Principal Component Analysis
- Image Compression with the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
