**Perceptron**

**Definition**

The perceptron is an algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers. A binary classifier is a function that can decide whether or not an input, represented by a vector of numbers, belongs to some specific class.

**Task & Data**

Here, I will build a perceptron model and implement the perceptron learning algorithm for binary species classification.
