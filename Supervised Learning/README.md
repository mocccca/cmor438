📚 What is Supervised Learning?

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model learns from labeled data — meaning, each training example comes with both the input and the correct output.

⚙️ How Supervised Learning Works

Collect labeled data: Each data point has input features and a known output.
Split into training and test sets: Usually 70–80% for training, the rest for testing.
Choose a model: Based on the problem and data type.
Train the model: Minimize the difference between predictions and true outputs using a loss function.
Evaluate performance: On the test set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall (for classification) or RMSE (for regression).

🔀 Two Main Types of Supervised Learning

Classification
- Predict a category or class.
- Output is discrete.
- Examples: Email spam detection, disease diagnosis, sentiment analysis.
Regression
- Predict a continuous value.
- Output is numeric.
- Examples: Predicting house prices, temperature, stock values.
